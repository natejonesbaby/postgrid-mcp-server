- `postgrid_estimate_cost` — Estimate mailing cost without an API call
- `postgrid_account_summary` — Show API mode, connectivity, and rate table

## Setup

### 1. Get API Keys

Sign up at [postgrid.com](https://www.postgrid.com) and get your API keys from the dashboard:

- **Print & Mail API key** — for contacts, letters, checks, templates
- **Address Verification API key** — for address verification tools

Both test and live keys are supported. Test keys start with `test_` and live keys start with `live_`.

### 2. Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nathanieljones/postgrid-mcp-server.git
cd postgrid-mcp-server
npm install
```

### 3. Configure

Create a `.env` file (or set environment variables):

```bash
POSTGRID_PRINT_API_KEY=test_sk_...
POSTGRID_VERIFY_API_KEY=test_sk_...
```

For live keys, you must also set:

```bash
POSTGRID_CONFIRM_LIVE_MODE=true
```

This prevents accidental sends with real postage.

**PDF upload (optional)** — To use `postgrid_upload_pdf`, configure Cloudflare R2:

```bash
R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_r2_access_key
R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_r2_secret_key
R2_ENDPOINT=https://<account_id>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com
R2_BUCKET=postgrid-pdfs
```

Create an R2 bucket in your Cloudflare dashboard and add a lifecycle rule to auto-delete objects after 1 day.

### 4. Add to Claude

**Claude Code** (`~/.claude.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "postgrid": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/full/path/to/postgrid-mcp-server/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "POSTGRID_PRINT_API_KEY": "test_sk_...",
        "POSTGRID_VERIFY_API_KEY": "test_sk_...",
        "R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID": "your_r2_access_key",
        "R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY": "your_r2_secret_key",
        "R2_ENDPOINT": "https://<account_id>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com",
        "R2_BUCKET": "postgrid-pdfs"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Claude Desktop / Cowork** (`claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "postgrid": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/full/path/to/postgrid-mcp-server/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "POSTGRID_PRINT_API_KEY": "test_sk_...",
        "POSTGRID_VERIFY_API_KEY": "test_sk_...",
        "R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID": "your_r2_access_key",
        "R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY": "your_r2_secret_key",
        "R2_ENDPOINT": "https://<account_id>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com",
        "R2_BUCKET": "postgrid-pdfs"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Safety Features

**Two-step confirmation** — `postgrid_create_letter` and `postgrid_create_cheque` require two calls. The first returns a cost preview; the second (with `confirmed: true`) actually sends.

**Live mode gate** — Live API keys require `POSTGRID_CONFIRM_LIVE_MODE=true` in the environment. Without it, the server refuses to start with live keys.

**Mode indicators** — Every response is prefixed with `[TEST]` or `[LIVE]` so you always know which mode you're in.

**Check safety thresholds** — Checks over $10,000 show a warning. Checks over $100,000 are rejected.

**Account number masking** — Bank account and routing numbers are masked in all responses.

**Idempotency** — Create operations include unique idempotency keys so network retries don't produce duplicates.
